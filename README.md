# Marketing-Budget-vs-Sales-Connection

Business Understanding:

The project focuses on the relationship between marketing promotional budgets (TV, Social Media, Radio) and sales. The analytics team aims to provide insights about the effectiveness of influencer marketing and guide future marketing efforts.


Data Understanding:

This project uses a dataset called marketing sales data(csv). Each row corresponds to an independent marketing promotion where the business invests in TV, Social_Media, and Radio promotions to increase Sales. There are about 4.6k rows, and 5 columns for each of the promotion methods and respective sale.


Modeling and Evaluation:

Starting with simple regression to multiple regression in order to consider how multiple variables influences the outcome variable. We moved to test of hypothesis, including ANOVA, Tukeyâ€™s HSD post hoc test to see how the predictor variables are related to each other.


Conclusion:

The analysis provided valuable insights to the stakeholders:
High TV promotion budgets lead to significantly higher sales than medium and low TV promotion budgets.
The one-way ANOVA test revealed a significant difference in sales based on TV promotion budget, and the post hoc test confirmed significant differences between all pairs of TV promotions.
These findings can help the company make informed decisions about allocating marketing budgets and focusing efforts on the most effective promotional channels to maximize sales.
